      Vinyl record sales keep spinning and spinning – with no end in sight
    </span>
    Just over 41 million vinyl records were sold in 2022, to the tune of $1.2bn (£.99bn). Only 33
    million CDs were sold, amounting to $483m. It was the 16th consecutive year of growth for record
    sales, about 71% of physical format revenues. Recorded music revenue in the US grew for the
    seventh consecutive year and reached a record high of $15.9bn.
